TASK: A-C1-003      ROLE: literature      REGIME: LITERATURE
PHASE: 1L   MODE: SOLVE   BRANCH: -
SUBJECT: -
TIME BOX: 25 minutes
READ ONLY: run/tasks/A-C1-003/ (this brief + inbox/). Do not open anything else under run/.
WRITE ONLY: run/tasks/A-C1-003/out/
TARGET: A-C1 "Lines in the Plane" (1 point, written proof). Verbatim: "We begin in the plane (d = 2), where the conjectured optimum splits the N lines as evenly as possible between two perpendicular directions. Let l_1, ..., l_N be lines in R^2. Prove that S(l_1, ..., l_N) <= (pi/2) floor(N^2/4)."
Exact target: for every N and all lines l_1, ..., l_N through the origin of R^2 (repetitions allowed), S(l_1, ..., l_N) = sum_{1<=i<j<=N} theta(l_i, l_j) <= (pi/2) floor(N^2/4), where theta(l, l') in [0, pi/2] is the acute (non-obtuse) angle between the lines, theta = arccos|<x, x'>| for spanning unit vectors x, x'. Definitions exactly as in inbox/statement.md.
Hand-in: a complete written proof; a step may rest on computation only with code included, running under 10 minutes, and rigorous (exact or interval arithmetic, or a bound on the numerical error). Say whether the cell is solved or partial.
STATEMENT RULE: Work from the exact statement in TARGET. Preserve every definition, quantifier, parameter range and hand-in requirement. Never infer the question from a cell's title.
ASSUMPTIONS: none beyond the statement
STOPPING CONDITION: stop when out/sources.md, your own attempt (out/proof.md, out/claims.md) and out/divergence.md are written
LESSONS: role-lessons.md v0, problem-lessons.md v0
RULES: any computation must be exact or interval arithmetic, code included, runtime < 10 min; state exactly what is established; citing a published result for the statement you are asked to prove does not count
RETURN: only the report block from your agent instructions, at most 200 words plus RAN lines.
        Full work goes in out/.
INBOX: role-lessons.md v0, problem-lessons.md v0, statement.md, target.md, checklist-G.md, earlier/A-C1-001/, earlier/A-C1-002/
PYTHON: /Users/raducucu/bainsahackathon/.venv/bin/python3 (sympy, mpmath, networkx, python-flint, python-sat); plain python3 lacks them.
        Checkers and anything a judge reruns stay stdlib-only unless the brief says otherwise.

You have web search and fetch. Tag every result PROVED / COMPUTER-VERIFIED / CONJECTURED, and say whether the
source contains the argument or only cites it. Flag computations whose code is unavailable and steps called
"routine" but not written down. Every claim carries a source link or a pointer to an artefact, plus a status tag.
Never present a citation as a proof of the cell itself. Never call anything new: write "not found in <sources searched>".
Your output never reaches blind agents.

Phase 1L. Inbox/earlier/ holds the Phase 1 blind results for this cell.
1. Find the literature for this cell and its neighbours, with links (out/sources.md: link, what was used, status).
2. Attempt the cell using known techniques (out/proof.md, out/claims.md).
3. Compare with the blind solvers: where do approaches differ or contradict? (out/divergence.md).
   Record which ideas came from the blind run, which from literature, and which are new here.
Blind and literature results are compared, never merged.
