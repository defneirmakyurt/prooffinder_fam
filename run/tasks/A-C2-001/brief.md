TARGET: A-C2 "An Orthogonality Lemma" (2 points, written proof). Verbatim: "A statement about a chain of vectors, in which each vector may fail to be orthogonal only to its immediate neighbours in the list. Let m >= 2 and let x_1, ..., x_m be unit vectors in R^(m-1) with <x_i, x_j> = 0 whenever |i - j| >= 2. Prove that sum_{i=1}^{m-1} theta(x_i, x_{i+1}) <= (m - 2) pi/2, where theta(x, y) = arccos |<x, y>|."
Exact target: for every integer m >= 2 and all unit vectors x_1, ..., x_m in R^(m-1) (dimension m-1, not m) such that <x_i, x_j> = 0 for all i, j with |i - j| >= 2, the chain sum sum_{i=1}^{m-1} theta(x_i, x_{i+1}) <= (m - 2) pi/2, where theta(x, y) = arccos|<x, y>| in [0, pi/2]. Only consecutive pairs (i, i+1) are summed. Definitions exactly as in inbox/statement.md.
Hand-in: a complete written proof; a step may rest on computation only with code included, running under 10 minutes, and rigorous (exact or interval arithmetic, or a bound on the numerical error). Say whether the cell is solved or partial.
STATEMENT RULE: Work from the exact statement in TARGET. Preserve every definition, quantifier, parameter range and hand-in requirement. Never infer the question from a cell's title.
ASSUMPTIONS: none beyond the statement
STOPPING CONDITION: Stop when proof.md proves TARGET completely for every m >= 2, or when the same rung fails twice; report the exact failing rung in stuck.md.
LESSONS: role-lessons.md v0, problem-lessons.md v0
RULES: any computation must be exact or interval arithmetic, code included, runtime < 10 min; state exactly what is established
RETURN: only the report block from your agent instructions, at most 200 words plus LADDER / RAN lines.
        Full work goes in out/.
INBOX: role-lessons.md v0, problem-lessons.md v0, statement.md, target.md, checklist-G.md
PYTHON: /home/user/bainsahackathon/.venv/bin/python3 (sympy, mpmath, networkx, python-flint, python-sat); plain python3 lacks them.
        Checkers and anything a judge reruns stay stdlib-only unless the brief says otherwise.

First write out/plan.md: TARGET as a ladder of numbered rungs (lemmas, special cases, reductions)
with dependencies. Work through it in order, marking each rung
PROVED / CHECKED / GAP / REFUTED / NOT STARTED.
Write out/proof.md. First line: the exact statement you prove, no more.
Then numbered steps; each justified by a definition, an earlier step, or a named lemma with exact reference.
"Clearly", "routine", "obviously", "similarly" and "by symmetry" may not replace an argument. Write the step out.
Mark anything you are not sure of [GAP].
Also write out/claims.md (claim | status | where proved), out/stuck.md (exact point of failure, or "none"),
and out/code/README.md (how to run any code) if you wrote code.
Check inbox/checklist-G.md item by item before you finish.
Numerics may guide you; any step resting on computation must include code in out/code/,
exact or interval arithmetic, runtime < 10 min.
If you executed code, fill in RAN exactly: what ran, parameter range, COMPLETED / TIMED OUT / PARTIAL, measured runtime.

Derive everything from first principles. Standard textbook tools are fine; results specific to this problem or its literature are not: if you recognise a known theorem about this problem, do not use it, work the argument out yourself. Cite no papers or authors.
