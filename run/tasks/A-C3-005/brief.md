TASK: A-C3-005      ROLE: literature      REGIME: LITERATURE
PHASE: 1L   MODE: SOLVE   BRANCH: -
SUBJECT: -
TIME BOX: 30 minutes
READ ONLY: run/tasks/A-C3-005/ (this brief + inbox/). Do not open anything else under run/.
WRITE ONLY: run/tasks/A-C3-005/out/
TARGET: Prove: for every integer d >= 1 and all lines l_1, ..., l_{d+1} through the origin of R^d (repetitions allowed), S(l_1, ..., l_{d+1}) = sum_{i<j} theta(l_i, l_j) <= (C(d+1, 2) - 1) * pi/2, where theta(l, l') = arccos |<x, x'>| for spanning unit vectors x, x' (the acute angle, in [0, pi/2]).
STATEMENT RULE: Work from the exact statement in TARGET. Preserve every definition, quantifier, parameter range and hand-in requirement. Never infer the question from a cell's title.
ASSUMPTIONS: none beyond the statement
STOPPING CONDITION: stop when sources.md, proof.md, claims.md and divergence.md are written (divergence may say the blind results were not yet available)
LESSONS: role-lessons.md v0, problem-lessons.md v0
RULES: any computation must be exact or interval arithmetic, code included, runtime < 10 min; state exactly what is established
RETURN: only the report block from your agent instructions, at most 200 words plus RAN lines.
        Full work goes in out/.
INBOX: role-lessons.md v0, problem-lessons.md v0, statement.md, target.md, checklist-G.md
PYTHON: /Users/defneirmakyurt/bainsahackathon/.venv/bin/python3 (sympy, mpmath, networkx, python-flint, python-sat); plain python3 lacks them.
        Checkers and anything a judge reruns stay stdlib-only unless the brief says otherwise.

You have web search and fetch. Tag every result PROVED / COMPUTER-VERIFIED / CONJECTURED, and say whether the
source contains the argument or only cites it. Flag computations whose code is unavailable and steps called
"routine" but not written down. Every claim carries a source link or a pointer to an artefact, plus a status tag.
Never present a citation as a proof of the cell itself. Never call anything new: write "not found in <sources searched>".
Your output never reaches blind agents.

Phase 1L. Inbox/earlier/ holds the Phase 1 blind results for this cell.
1. Find the literature for this cell and its neighbours, with links (out/sources.md: link, what was used, status).
2. Attempt the cell using known techniques (out/proof.md, out/claims.md).
3. Compare with the blind solvers: where do approaches differ or contradict? (out/divergence.md).
   Record which ideas came from the blind run, which from literature, and which are new here.
Blind and literature results are compared, never merged.
